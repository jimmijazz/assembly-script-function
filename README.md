# Shopify Function using Assembly Script Example

## Steps to run
1. Download repo
2. Download and configure [Function Runner](https://github.com/Shopify/function-runner) 
3a. To just build the WASM files - npm run build
3b. To build and run using function runner - npm run build-run

The main file you work in is index.ts.
Once a Function is built, the .wasm file will be available in the 'build' folder. The release.wasm file is what you provide to Shopify.
